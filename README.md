# History and Background
The Language and Voice Laboratory was founded in 2016 at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is/) by Jón Guðnason 
as a part of [CADIA](http://cadia.ru.is/) to bring an emphasis on processing speech and spoken language. 
He was later joined by other professors such as, Hrafn Loftsson, who brought in a focus on written language, 
Hannes, who brought in a focus on human-computer interactions.
Our research is focused on finding the right patterns to understand speech and to process, interpret, 
and understand natural language. Our goal is to deepen theoretical and practical knowledge as well as 
enable human communication with each other and computers through technology.
We were formerly a member of [Almannarómur](https://almannaromur.is/).
